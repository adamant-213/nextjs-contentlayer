Over the course of my education and professional experience, I’ve taken on a wide range of projects that span software development, hardware integration, and system administration. 
These projects have allowed me to work in diverse programming languages, frameworks, and platforms—each one sharpening my technical and problem-solving skills.

## Software Development

When it comes to C#, my most recent specialty is utilizing XAML in .NET Framework 5.0, but I am very familiar with Winforms in .NET 4.8
There are many differences between .NET 4.8 and .NET 5.0, it took me a lot of time to learn the differences between them for practical applications.
I’ve built UI solutions in **C#** using both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 5.0, ranging from manufacturing equipment logging systems to maintenance dashboards.
 These systems were designed with performance and reliability in mind, supporting daily manufacturing operations in high-volume production environments.

In **Java**, I’ve developed OOP-based applications with a focus on modularity and maintainability. My most recent one being a text-based adventure.
My university projects in this language included both desktop applications and backend logic for distributed systems.

## Web Development

In my side projects, I’ve used **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS** to create modern, responsive UIs. 
The website you are looking at right now is an example of this skillset.
In the past, I have used the JQuerry library ontop of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website during my nearly 3-year internship at BorgWarner.
My work also includes **SharePoint** site development and internal department portals to centralize resources and improve communication.

## Data Analytics and Visualization

During my internship at BorgWarner I was exposed to integrating large Excel files into a **Microsoft Power Bi** dashboard.
The utilization of these tools at BorgWarner was for an assset management system as well as a purchase tracking system.
My projects using **Spotfire** have helped turn raw manufacturing and quality data into actionable insights. 

These tools were critical in tracking performance metrics and improving operational efficiency.

## System Administration and Automation

I have hands-on experience with **Linux** (Ubuntu and CentOS) server administration, **VMware ESXi** deployment, and network environment configuration. 
Automation of routine tasks has been achieved through **Bash** and UNIX shell scripting, ensuring efficiency in system management.

Many of the operational tasks I performed at my former job were supported by **Python** scripting and CSV processing

## Hardware-Integrated Systems

Some of my most challenging projects involved maintaining and upgrading Windows-based manufacturing test equipment, 
ensuring compatibility with **National Instruments** software, and troubleshooting across hardware, software, and network interfaces.

These projects not only demonstrate my ability to work across multiple languages and platforms but also highlight my adaptability—
whether it’s building from scratch, integrating into existing systems, or maintaining critical production tools.
