Welcome! I'm excited you're here.

This blog is where I‚Äôll share insights from my work in IT, software, manufacturing systems, and whatever else I happen to be building or learning. Whether you're a fellow engineer, student, or just curious about technology ‚Äî thanks for stopping by.

## üëã Who Am I?

Hi, I‚Äôm **Adam Berndt** ‚Äî an emerging IT engineer with experience in **manufacturing systems**, **data analytics**, and **automation**. I enjoy bridging the gap between code and the physical world, whether it‚Äôs through backend systems, hardware interfaces, or data pipelines.

My current toolkit includes a mix of **C#**, **Oracle SQL (PL/SQL)**, **MES tools**, and analytics platforms like **Power Bi**. I'm always exploring new technologies and looking for ways to streamline workflows and solve real-world problems.

## üéì My Background

> ‚ÄúUs engineers wear many hats.‚Äù  
> That‚Äôs something one of my early mentors told me ‚Äî and the longer I work in the field, the more I realize how true it is.

I‚Äôm a graduate of **Purdue Polytechnic**, where I earned a degree in **Computer Networking & Information Technology**. Since then, I‚Äôve worked across a wide range of technical domains ‚Äî from writing code to validating manufacturing systems, and from deploying infrastructure to designing analytics dashboards.

Here are a few things I‚Äôve worked on:

- Built internal tools using **C#** and the .NET framework (4.8 and 5.0)
- Created and maintained **PL/SQL-based systems** in Oracle
- Designed **Power BI** dashboards with **DAX** and **M-Code**
- Supported and validated test systems with **LabVIEW** and **TestStand**
- Ran Ethernet, configured routers and switches, and deployed **VMware ESXi** environments
- Interfaced with microcontrollers, basic **FPGA** tools, and **PCB hardware**

No matter the task, I‚Äôm driven by a passion for learning and a love of making technology work better for people.
